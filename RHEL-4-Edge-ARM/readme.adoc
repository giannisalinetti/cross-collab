== Introduction
The target of this use case is to investigate if it is possible to deploy RHEL for Edge image on ARM based far-Edge devices like NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Xavier/TX2 or Raspberry Pi devices. There are aleady certain amount of work gone into this effort by engineering and product management from both Red Hat and NVIDIA. 

But as far as I know, so far the efforts are limited to the higher end Jetsons like TX2 and Xaviers. So here we are attempting to try and run RHEL for Edge on lower end devices. The idea is to document as much as we can. It could be a failure at the end, but would be a good start for the further development of the tools surrounding it. 

== Setup

=== Prepare Build VM
For this installation we need to first prepare an ARM instance on AWS or similar platform. We chose AWS because of the availability of the free tier and the availability of RHEL for ARM image availability. Following are the steps we have used to spin the VM up.

==== Laptop prep for AWS CLI
[NOTE]
====
You may skip this step

- if you already have AWS cli installed on your laptop/PC 
- or if you are not using Mac
- or you prefer using AWS Web Console 
- or you are using a different platform for your builder VM
====

===== Assumptions
- It is assumed that you already have got the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. In case if you have not, please refer https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-prereqs.html for more information.
- A local SSH key pair is already generated and is available under `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

===== CLI instalation
[source,bash]
----
$ curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
$ sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
$ which aws
$ aws --version
----
[TIP]
Please refer https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-troubleshooting.html for troubleshooting the CLI installation.

===== Configure AWS CLI profile
[source,bash]
----
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
Default region name [None]: ap-south-1
Default output format [None]: yaml
----

===== Create a SSH key pair

[source,bash]
----
aws --region ap-south-1 ec2 \
import-key-pair \
--key-name "my-ssh-pub-key" \
--public-key-material "$(openssl enc -base64 -A -in $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)"
----

===== Create a security group
[source,bash]
----
# New Security Group
aws --region ap-south-1 ec2 create-security-group \
    --group-name rhel-access \
    --description "RHEL 4 Edge Access"
# Allow SSH Access
aws --region ap-south-1 ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-name rhel-access \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 22 \
    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
----

===== Spinning up the VM
[NOTE]
====
`ami-0cbe04a3ce796c98e` is `RHEL-8.4.0_HVM-20210504-arm64-2-Hourly2-GP2` in ap-south-1 with EBS backed disk. It could be different based on the region you chose to deploy the instance. Please search for RHEL arm64 images in your selected region. 
====

[source,bash]
----
aws --region ap-south-1 ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0cbe04a3ce796c98e \
    --instance-type t4g.small \
    --key-name my-ssh-pub-key \
    --security-groups rhel-access
----

=== Build Image 

==== Register host and Install packages
[source,bash]
----
ORGID=[Red Hat Org ID]
ACT_KEY=[Activation Key]
subscription-manager register --org $ORGID --activationkey $ACT_KEY
yum install osbuild-composer composer-cli cockpit-composer bash-completion
systemctl enable osbuild-composer.socket --now
systemctl enable cockpit.socket --now
systemctl restart osbuild-composer

----

==== Create a directory to hold the build files
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /root/repo && cd $_
----

==== Create Blueprint
[source,bash]
----
cat > blueprint.toml <<EOF
name = "arm-image"
description = "Image for ARM based SoC"
version = "0.0.1"
modules = [ ]
groups = [ ]
EOF
----

==== Build an edge-commit image
[source,bash]
----
composer-cli blueprints push blueprint.toml
composer-cli blueprints depsolve arm-image
build=$(composer-cli compose start arm-image edge-commit | awk '{print $2}')
status=""
while [ "x$status" != "xFINISHED" ] ; do 
    status=$(composer-cli compose status |grep $build|awk '{print $2}')
    echo -en "."
    sleep 3
done
mkdir images && cd $_
composer-cli compose image $build
----

==== Nginx config
[source,bash]
----
cd /root/repo
cat <<EOF > nginx.conf
events {
}
http {
    server{
        listen 8080;
        root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        location / {
            autoindex on;
            }
        }
     }
pid /run/nginx.pid;
daemon off;
EOF
----

==== Dockerfile to host RHEL repo
[source,bash]
----
cat <<EOF > Dockerfile
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
RUN yum -y install nginx && yum clean all
ARG kickstart
ARG commit
ADD \$commit /usr/share/nginx/html/
ADD nginx.conf /etc/
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["/usr/sbin/nginx", "-c", "/etc/nginx.conf"]
EOF
----

==== Build raw.xz image
[source,bash]
----
#WIP
----

== Prepare Jetson Nano
In this step we are following the steps from https://nullr0ute.com/2020/11/installing-fedora-on-the-nvidia-jetson-nano/ upto "Getting Fedora running". You can also avoid the section "Jetson TX1 and TX2" in case you are not targetting TX1 or TX2.

== Burn / Flash the image.

Download the image from builder VM to your local PC/laptop where you can burn/flash the image to a SD card. Please follow the command below. 

[source,bash]
----
dnf install -y usbutils uboot-images-armv8 arm-image-installer
arm-image-installer \
 --media=/dev/sdf \
 --resizefs \
 --target=rpi4 \
 --image=62daf6c7-8d96-4d76-8f24-f6aaa2f79dbe-image.raw.xz

|The image generated by the builder wouldn't boot the Jetson Nano. I tried it on Raspberry Pi also, where it was complaining about missing files in the EFI partition. Copied over files except `EFI` folder from Fedora Server ARM image to the image from builder and the raspberry pi at least booted and hung where it was trying to mount a partition. Later after a timeout I was dropped in to a `dracut` prompt. Here is a screenshot where it hung image:images/rpi-rhel-boot-hung.jpeg[]
